Dear Mr. Bourdieu, 

Could you just summarize your definition of the state? 

Thank you! 

**Stéphane**

Very sincerely, no. The state exists only in the form of a representation, which has varied greatly over time. It is therefore possible to account for what the State is today (in Western countries) only if one tries to make history. The subject is extremely broad and can only be approached in a rigorous way if one limits the problem within which one is curious to characterize the State.

If you give me the reason why you are asking about the nature of the state, perhaps I could submit my point of view.

**Pierre Bourdieu**

**The reason for my question is very simple: during a course of politics, I had to make a dissertation on "the definition of the State" according to Marx, Weber and you.**

**As far as your definition is concerned, I have come, unkindly, to admit it:**

>The state is the result of a process of concentration of the different kinds of capital: capital of physical force or instrument of coercion (army, police), economic capital, cultural or information capital and symbolic capital, The emergence of a truly State capital, or metacapital, which allows the exercise of power over other species of capital.

**Then, in order to establish this definition, I tried to justify it as follows:**

According to Bourdieu, society is divided between dominant and dominated. The members of the ruling class, the nobility of the state "who derives the conviction of its legitimacy in the academic title and in the authority of science and the economy" , legitimizes technocracy to appropriate the power of The state while maintaining the perception of a disinterested attitude. The latter is merely the result of the evolution of the process of concentration of the different species of capital of physical, economic, information and symbolic force which enables it to assert itself as the ultimate power of economic, social and cultural domination.

In order to be more legitimate, the state uses its power of domination in order to impose cognitively on its line of thought, especially by the school. He mastered the art of manipulation so well that he succeeded in transforming the consequences of his actions (unemployment, poverty, immigration, academic failures) into social problems, so that even the social sciences legitimized them by labeling them with sociological problems. Bourdieu particularly mentions the role played by lawyers who develop the raison d'etat in which the bureaucracy would even adopt laws and regulations to define its functioning and acknowledge its principles while satisfying its own narcissistic interests.

On the subject of school indoctrination, he quotes Thomas Bernhard as saying that "school is the school of the State, where young people are made the creature of the State ... The State has made I was a regulated and registered man, trained, and graduated, and perverted and depressed. " But this intellectual programming would work so well that when the state tries to make changes like grammar, Spelling or changes to the school curriculum, it is the whole fabric of society that stands up against this change that he has managed to teach us as the "one and only best way".

Bourdieu uses different forms of capital to rationalize his analysis. These assets are used, among other things, to define the status or social position of an individual in that society. Let's take a closer look at them:

##Capital of Physical Strength

This form of capital represents the coercive forces of the army and the police. The army is in fact a professional army, isolated from society and monopolizing the force around the external perimeter of the legitimate territory of the State. This was created by the elimination of feudal forces and internal competition. Then, in order to protect themselves from the rebellion of this internal competition, and to ensure the monopoly of force within the perimeter, the State created the police.

##Economic capital

In order to supply its coercive forces, which require large resources, the State introduced taxation based on uncollected levy and redistribution, which also served as a symbolic capital transformation. In order to regularize and indoctrinate the normality of the levies, the State succeeded in institutionalizing, bureaucratizing and nationalizing them by introducing various repressive modes of opposition by using its coercive capital. This nationalization, which is manifested by the growth of a sense of belonging, actually reinforces the weight of economic power among other things by the creation of the national currency. Therefore, coercive capital requires the economic capital that generates symbolic capital, which requires coercive capital. At the level of society and its individuals, economic capital tends to be transmitted from generation to generation, so that the ruling class manages to maintain its exclusive power.

##Information and cultural capital

By concentrating economic resources, the state manages to monopolize information. It is thus that it can better collect, col- lect, control and redistribute it in order to support its manipulations of self-satisfaction (indoctrination). It is therefore able to manipulate statistics and national accounts, cartography, culture, the school system and national identity. At the social level, it can be noted that this culture tends to be mainly linked to the diploma and the seniority of its access by the family.

##Symbolic capital

Symbolic capital is in fact the exercise of the perception of other capitalist forces according to a cognitive and personal interpretation that the State has succeeded in inculcating. Somewhat in the same sense as the definition of conflict of interest, there is a conflict of interests not when it is real, but when there is a perception of it. The state then tries to influence this perception by using other forms of capital. In our case, a comparison is possible by comparing the federal government's sponsorship program, which was designed to influence people's cognitive perceptions. From the social point of view, it's come into play LA politics and power games or using the circle of relationships to promote the inclusion of children in the special education system or the labor market, or Simply by partisan appointments to titles of nobility or favors, which in turn reinforce this own power within the technocrat state itself.

In your opinion, do I hope to be able to claim to have understood your teachings somewhat or should I immediately reconvert to macrame?

Thank you!

Rest assured, you seem to develop ideas that are fair enough. There is one thing, however, which I think deserves to be somewhat re-written. Throughout your justification, you speak of the state as a person with intentions. In short, your state is hypostatized. An important question is thus overlooked: it is that of knowing to whom the State benefits. And this question is not as simple to resolve as it seems. There may be direct beneficiaries and indirect beneficiaries. Thus, the marching bourgeoisie prefers that the political power reverts to the petty bourgeoisie, for the latter, while thinking to pursue its own interests, can serve those of the marching bourgeoisie. This is, of course, just one example. It is also another question which deserves to be asked: it is the question of the transfer of powers to places other than the State. In short, the question is complex and can not be resolved by the presentation of a continuous mechanism of monopolization.

But I encourage you to continue your reflection; You are certainly on the right track.
