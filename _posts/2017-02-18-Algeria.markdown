Mr. Bourdieu, 

For years, you have spread so many analyzes of society in the media that they have made you one of the main cops of French thought. These "analyzes" boasted of a certain rigor, that of sociology, which has no scientist but the name. 
Indeed, this pseudo-science, of which you have made yourself the number one VRP, is based on the study of correlations, a method which does not allow us to reveal causalities, that is to say, Conclusion other than those emanating from the subjectivity of the sociologist himself. From ideology to scientific appearance. 
Do not you think, dear sir, that as Lacan said about psychoanalysis, sociology, and therefore your work, can be summarized by these few sentences: "Our practice is a swindle. Bluffing, making people shudder, dazzle them with words that are checks ... From the ethical point of view, it's untenable, our profession ... " 
Yours.

You defend a point of view that I will not dispute with you. He is yours and I leave it to you. As much aggressiveness and gratuitous accusations do not call for dialogue, I think.
