Mr. Bourdieu, 

How sorry to have never been able to meet you. You came to visit me a few years ago at the university in which I am, but at that time I was far from all sociological thoughts. .. Today I discover your work, and it fascinates me ... Your theory of habitus accompanies me every day, it teaches me about myself and about others ... To those who accused you To kill free will, on the contrary, you replied that your theory was that of freedom ... I admire the man and the thinker that you are ... 

Yours, 

**Emma** ... student in sociology ... At the beginning of the course ...

I have nothing to answer what is not a question. I hope that you will find in the study of sociology the opportunities to cultivate this approach, at once humble and stubborn, of the truth that keeps falsehood - both of its own and of others.  

**Pierre Bourdieu**
