Mr. Editor, 

Having recently freed me from the determinations that were put on me by the cultural, academic, school and other fields to which I was involved, I see an opportunity to finally find time to answer any questions that your Readers could ask about my work. It is therefore very willing that I accept today to appear on your site. 

Please accept, Mr. Editor, the expression of my best regards. 

**Pierre Bourdieu**
