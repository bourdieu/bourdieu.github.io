Hello,

What can a sociologist bring me individually as a friend?

**Jean-Claude Lebas**

I confess I do not fully understand the scope of your question. Friendship is definitely a very important feeling that can arise on multiple occasions. Why not between people who collaborate in sociology work. But sociological competence does not predispose especially to friendship, nor does it distance it from it. 

**Pierre Bourdieu**
