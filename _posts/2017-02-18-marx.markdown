Good morning, Mr. Bourdieu, 

Allow me first of all to show you the boundless admiration I have for you. 

Then, can you tell me what you think of Karl Marx?

I consider the work of Karl Marx of the highest interest. The intelligence of his thought has unfortunately been tarnished by his success, a success which has transformed some aspects into catechism. Marx was the subject of a kind of religious devotion which condemned his followers as many of his opponents to simplism and caricature.

It is important to read or re-read Marx. And to read it by clearing as far as possible his mind of the prejudices that the different avatars of Marxism could have brought forth. It is an opportunity to discover a way of understanding the social world which is an extremely important step in the history of sociological thought. It is also an opportunity to better understand all the later sociological thoughts (Weber, Durkheim, Mauss, Levi-Strauss, etc.), notably through what they should-even without claiming- Karl Marx.
