We are final-year pupils at the Romorantin Girls' High School and our ambition is limited to trying to survive until the baccalauréat, after which we will hasten to forget all our bad memories of this year, among which the philosophy will not be Not in the last place. In mathematics we do not understand much, but at least we do not have the impression that in this subject the professors are fighting each other: in your discipline, on the contrary, not only everything seems gibberish, but One asks us to speak Chinese and the other to speak Hebrew. 

You say for example of Jean-François Revel that he is not a philosopher. It is your right, and besides, our professor, who admires you, thinks exactly like you; Only at Lycee de Garcons is the opposite: the professor of philosophy swears only by Revel and considers you (pass us the word we are only repeating) as a fumister. How do you expect poor high school students to be there? 

Two years ago our French teacher in the second year had begun the year by commenting on excerpts from your book "On Television" which he presented as a model of bad faith. We take up the lecture notes: "Time does not matter, as we say in Le Misanthrope, we can very well spend ten years criticizing a book and producing only a stupidity: c Chapelain is indeed the case with "La Pucelle". Bourdieu can be a professor at the Collège de France, it only proves his relations: Chapelain was "the best of all the best minds" ... You tell me that I have no right to treat him as a " imbecile? Do you think he is embarrassed to do it with those who do not please him? Only he squints in front of a handful of peeled and shorn and he writes nonsense that nobody reads ... As nowhere would one be crazy enough to ask him for an editorial he has decided to scream against the editorials. 

All this to explain to us that the great writers were the novelists who succeeded in getting themselves read, and the authors of the theater whose plays were applauded. "You must choose between Moliere and Trissotin." You guess that this French teacher and our philosophy professor are in the worst of terms and they hate each other so openly that many girls are convinced that they are going to get married. By boys we know that in their high school their professor of philosophy is not more tender with you, but we have not looked at their courses since with one we do not already understand anything. 

So what do we have to do at the baccalaureate? If we quote you, and we fall upon a corrector who thinks like Monsieur X. it is the wrong note assured, and it is the same catastrophe that awaits us if we rely on Revel and are corrected by Mademoiselle Y. Or its clone. And if we do not quote anybody we will be told that we know nothing and that we have not read anything. We should shoot a coin or a coin to give us a good or bad rating: it would not be fairer but it would be less tiring for us. 

On top of that, our professor of French had warned us two years ago: "When you go to the dissertations of philosophy have no hope. If the editor is not of your opinion, he will consider your copy as pretentious foolishness ... and if he shares your opinion he will judge that you discredit him by bad arguments. "As we were still naive, we thought that I was only fooling. 

We hope you will answer and we thank you in advance.

What strategy should be adopted to maximize the chances of success in school trials? This is a question that is often debated but never resolved. It is very difficult, as a student, to uncover paying attitudes and those that penalize. One sees in fact succeed in the same way sometimes fellow-students "boot-boots" who flatter shamelessly the professors, sometimes others who defy them audaciously. And although it may seem clever to espouse the opinions of teachers, even in spite of their calls for sincerity, it is sometimes better to succeed than anyone else who, precisely, dares to contradict them systematically. 

The school system is undergoing hidden selection processes. No more than students, professors are fully aware of what promotes success. It is even to a large extent thanks to cross-illusions that the transmission of privileges is accomplished. The professor is easily convinced that his mission and the way in which it is carried out allows the transfer of knowledge, the more or less good acquisition of which will serve as a filter for the delivery of diplomas. The pupil himself is easily convinced that his intelligence and his work remain the first guarantors of his success (and one of the ways to use his intelligence during the tests would be to adapt his behavior, opinions and responses to What is believed to be the teacher's expectations). But what determines the professor's final judgment is made up of a set of signs which he himself does not know how well he captures them. And the student who sends them is not aware of it either. These signs reflect a long familiarity with the culture which the school is imbued with, and which, even more than in the knowledge itself, is recognized by the way in which it was acquired. A certain ease in expression, a certain distance from the subjects to be learned, those little non-scholarly knowledge which are so readily taken for intelligence, all this increases the chances of success much more than the exact and scrupulous restitution Culminating in a laborious study. 

The cynical prediction of your French teacher is likely to increase the confusion conducive to hidden processes. It has merit only to clumsily translate the mechanism that the paths of success remain mysterious in the eyes of the actors. But it transforms into fatality what is only an effect of ignorance. On the other hand, when she refuses my analysis the credit that would be due to a professor of the College de France, she is right. It may have omitted, after having done justice to such a prejudice, to question the relevance of the same analyzes when these were not the work of a professor at the College de France. Unless the hypothesis of the illusion in which the teachers lived their trade disturbs her, she may think that what guides her professional practice is entirely transparent to her. The principle of non-conscience is often difficult to accept when it comes to doubting the reasons we give ourselves to act. This is true for both the sociologist and the teacher. But to deny it to the absolute freedom of choice is no doubt alienating us even more. 

There is, however, a good reason for defending the ideas which are believed, independently of the opinions of his professors. It is that, in any case, one generally remains better when one expresses one's convictions than when one pretends to approve those of another.
