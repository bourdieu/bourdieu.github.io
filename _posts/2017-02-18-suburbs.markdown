Hello sir,

What did you think of what the media called the "suburban crisis" in early November 2005? Did the young people who burned these cars have a project, or was this explosion just a "display game", the aim of which would have been no more than to be "present at the twenty o'clock Of TF1 "?

The question you are putting to me here deserves, I think, a detailed answer. So allow me to take the time to think about it before drafting it.
That seems to me perfectly logical. Take whatever time you find useful.
