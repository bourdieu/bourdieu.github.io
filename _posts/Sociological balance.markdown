Professor of the College de France, 

Can you tell me, by arguing in a nuanced way, whether you support the thesis of holism or methodological individualism? 

In thanking you for your intellectual greatness, 

**Mr Alpha +**

You know that I have often been led to denounce the false oppositions by which the dominant thought so easily diverts from the real stakes. The vogue of holism is part of this kind of confusion. 

What is holistic? The word comes from the Greek "holos" which means everything, totality. And it is commonly used by economists and sociologists who seek to stigmatize those who refuse neoclassical economic theories, who attach particular importance to what would be "individualistic". Treating someone as "holistic" therefore usually has something pejorative. 

In fact, like many others, this opposition has little meaning, except in that it testifies to the ruses of the dominant thought. To oppose holism and individualism is to perpetuate the perpetual opposition between society and the individual, as if the truth of the social world must necessarily be found in a social body foreign to each of the agents that compose it or, on the contrary, in each individual, creator of himself , Safe from what others expect of him. 

The reality is otherwise complex. The dispositions that determine us are at the same time the effect of the social world and the product of what each agent is doing. They exist only in the course of exercising, which testifies to an extremely dialectical process which I proposed to situate in what I called habitus. 

So I do not support holism or individualism. Rather, I encourage to uncover behind this kind of concept the subtle realities that explain our behavior.
