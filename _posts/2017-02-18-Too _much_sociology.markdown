I am afraid of the place that sociology takes today, this quite recent science is today really invasive. Everything (or almost) is seen from the angle of the classes ... And the individual alone ... Are you going to defend sociology, now that you have left the city of Men? 

Good and if not, is it really you? So tell me the name of your sociologist friend whose name is also that of a drink, eh! Hey! 

Although sociologically,

You are far from being the only one that sociology frightens. Perhaps it would not be useless to try to find out where this fright originated, which explains it. 

You say that sociology now takes up a lot of space. I am not personally persuaded. Of course, over the last decade we have witnessed an expansion of the academic structures which claim to organize research and teaching in the so-called human sciences. There is now a multitude of diplomas which sanction formations supposed to owe an important part of their authority to sociology. And at the same time, the number of publications (books, magazines, periodicals) found in the "sociology" of booksellers has grown steadily. But it must be admitted that, simultaneously, rigor took a bad blow. There is indeed an increasingly frequent drift in research. The latter is all the more willing to subscribe to the demands of politics, production and the market that it has been placed in situation to find its means of existence with those who have become its customers. The conditions of a rigorous research, such as Max Weber, for example, had defined them, are now often regarded as outdated. Now, to believe that what is new is a priori better is the first characteristic of fashion and not that of progress. And fashion often devastates the best things, in that it conceals error and stigmatizes the righteous. 

If the word "sociology" were to be reserved for the rigorous efforts deployed by certain researchers in order to provide explanatory hypotheses on the way things happen within the social world (which will obviously not be obtained ), We should no doubt realize that sociology occupies a much more modest place today than was the case ten or twenty years ago. Again this sociology maintains a permanent concern for quality which is quite comforting. 

All this to tell you that it seems to me that sociology can frighten in two different ways. If it is your omnipresence, I am ready to advise you to ignore it as much as possible, for this omnipresent sociology will teach you very little, if not to swallow the snakes produced by the current ideology , The one that pretends not to be one and that gives the change by affirming the death of ideologies. If it is the disturbing aspect of rigorous sociology that preoccupies you, then I can only suggest that you be all the more attentive to what it states. For it is true that sociology can only disturb, since it brings to light the causalities invisible to the profane actor of the social world. And if your reaction is to reject what disturbs you, to take it for false, then tell yourself well that you are likely to remain the plaything of social determinations. Think, for example, that Durkheim published in 1897 a study which shows that suicide is an act whose principal determinations are alien to the consciousness of the individual, and yet a century later the survivors are still treated Of suicide as well as those responsible for their state, which would misuse medical means. 

The fear of sociological knowledge comes, of course, from its inevitable claim to human behavior, an explanation that contradicts the commonly accepted explanation. What determines man to act largely escapes his consciousness, but does not prevent him from convincing himself that he knows the motives of his actions. One might even say that it is precisely through the reasons that man gives himself to act that determinations, which, unbeknownst to himself, will drive him to do what the social system expects of him. This makes lucidity costly, costly and uncertain. For it is not enough to construct theories that contradict common sense in order to dare to believe in truth. It is important to measure, to verify, to experiment, to test, to criticize, to calibrate, to collate and to pass. Research is an incessant battle against error, beginning with its own mistakes. 

And the individual alone? do you ask me. You probably want to suggest, by your question, that it would not be right to neglect what can be learned about human behavior by looking at what it does not owe to the influence of others. Well, I am ready to concede that man is not merely the product of his environment. But if the social determinations remain, despite the difficulty, detectable and measurable, it is probably not the same with the rest. It is probably far away the time when the advances in genetics will isolate what behavior has to genes. And in the meantime, it would be a shame not to prospect what is now accessible, namely the social world. Still, it must be done with modesty and method. 

As for your question about a sociologist friend with the name of a drink, it astonishes me. Not because I had several friends whose patronymic evoked a beverage, but because it manifests a doubt about my own reality. If you think that I am not the one I claim to be, then go your way: Dialogus is not your business!
