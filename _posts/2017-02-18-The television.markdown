Dear Mr. Bourdieu, 

I recently saw your television show on the program "Still Image". And we have seen a real practice of your writings on television, namely that it is really not the place of free expression, that its organization, and perhaps even the form of the medium, filter The information given, and above all, the position of the speaker seems to validate a priori the content of the speech. Thus, your performance was televised badly, and it is clear that you could not get your message on television, on television. I think of Mr Cavada who was starting all his answers by a nice compliment to you, to show the world its good will and thereby validate all critical that you addressed in the remainder of the sentence, especially since télévisuellement Mr. Cavada is perceived as valid, that he knows it and that he plays it . As a result, all your answers, even incredibly logical and justified, sounded hollow by this simple fact. 

So I would like to know what were the reasons that drove you back to the small screen during a dialogue with Gunter Grass? Why did not you give preference to written dialogue? What does television recording do in this case? 

Yours truly, 

**A reader**

I fully understand your question. The fact is that we are inevitably torn between two attitudes: one would be definitive abstention on the grounds that the "system" condemns us in advance to pay the costs of the program; The other would be the frequent intrusion into the television world with the hope of weighing the rules of the game. This dilemma is comparable to that of recognizing the results of research within the social body: The gap between the doxa deprives the victims of the most subtle influences of any means of elucidation; To interfere in the political field undermines the conditions necessary for a good process of objectification. 

I am sure you know that, after having for a long time confined myself to an attitude that is essentially concerned with the scientific nature of research, I chose - in the early 1990s - to act and to explain my reasons for action. It was not for me to change my mind about the scientist's posture, but to adapt my behavior to a context in which it is essential to find a fragile balance between contradictory demands. My past career, and the age at which I was able, on the one hand, and the growing strength of the liberal reaction, on the other, have determined me to engage in a struggle away from which I had long held myself. 

All this does not mean that I was always effective. The strength of the "system" lies notably in the fact that the force of the criticism of the "system" constitutes for those who bathe in it the demonstration that it is vainly denied that things are of themselves, 

As far as the dialogue with Günther Grass was concerned, it was not his ambition to replace a writing, but to show what we could say in the course of a conversation. And to do it through television, was to preserve this form of encounter a part of its authenticity.
