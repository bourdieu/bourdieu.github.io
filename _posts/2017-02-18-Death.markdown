Is death a form of distinction?

No, death is not a form of distinction. I would have liked to come back to the various meanings of the word "distinction", and more particularly to the regrettable ambiguities to which the title of the book I published in 1979 on the subject gave rise. But your question obviously does not invite it. Its true nature prompts me merely to remark that, in our days, in order to be distinguished, it must not be too much to be distinguished.
