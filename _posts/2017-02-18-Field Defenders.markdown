Dear Mr. Pierre Bourdieu, 

I wanted to congratulate you already for your hard work and for your awareness of the labor difficulties in our country. You knew how to play the media, without abusing it ... In fact, you remained natural ... 
My main knowledge is sociological, although limited. I stopped sociology, because I began to think that this was the science of opinion ... Besides, it is a trajectory like yours that gave me the " Want to understand the world as meaningful and structured fields of norms and values. 

So do not be angry if I leave it to you. Many have assailed you on your stance in the 1995 strike ... I know, but I still had to be very young, about 12 years ... We talked a lot about this social movement: Point the destruction of a civilization under the yoke of savage liberalism, perceived by a ton of railwaymen as a barbarism. 

I have two questions for you. The first: what were your relations with Alain Touraine on the 1995 crisis? I imagine him more individualistic than you, still advocating somewhere the predominance of the social actor and his responsibility as subject in relation to other subjects ... I would therefore like to know the conclusions that were required vis-à- Vis this great structured social movement. 

And another question, this time concerning you, and of a global order: how has a man, who has become aware of the multiplicity of social fields and who does not share them, determines himself in relation to his Franco- Algerian (I count military service as a ritual education to adult life), to his philosophical and literary training? 

Thank you. 

**Olivier Bourgais **

*PS .: I just want to inform you that you would probably have liked to beat the pavement on the beautiful morning of 21 April 2005! Mr. Le Pen and Mr. Chirac then clashed for the presidential ... Millions of men outside. I did not share their enthusiasm for the National Front, because the mass media and the same political parties, on the right, left and extreme left, after having supported the theme of insecurity, Elect the most "representative" of the whole. We voted 82% for Mr. Chirac and his minions! No, I did not share what was in advance a moral and mass defeat. Well, what would you have done?*

All my interventions in the political field were painful. They represented a necessity for me, because I had gradually acquired the conviction that the reserve of the scientist made of it a mummy little able to disturb the sleep of the powerful of this world. But at the same time there remained to me an uneasiness connected with the respect in which I had long held the Weberian principles, which proclaim action and knowledge, politics and the scientist incompatible. This problem was all the more painful for me, as she sometimes opposed old friends such as Jean-Claude Passeron. Alain Touraine has never known these agonies: he has always mixed sociological analysis and political judgment without any embarrassment.

I must confess that I do not understand your last question. I tried, during my last lesson at the College de France, to take a look as objective as possible on the sociological questions that can pose my personal itinerary. I did so by disregarding all that escaped the project thus defined, and especially by all the biographical anecdotes which generally betray a certain self-complacency.
