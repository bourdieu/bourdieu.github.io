Hello Pierre! 

Being currently a student in the prestigious but nevertheless very classical Sorbonne University, I discover with passion sociology and have some questions to ask you on this subject. 

What do you think of Durkheim's anomie concept? We try to get our thoughts into our minds without thinking about them beyond measure, but for me the right to marginality is essential and forms the basis of all human progress, whether political or cultural. What is the right of this sexist conservative to impose his norms and his pretended moral order on us? 

Hope to have your opinion on it.

Durkheim had, rightly so, the desire to make sociology a rigorous discipline, of sufficient rigor to enable it to compete in its methods with traditional scientific disciplines. All his work bears witness to this desire for rigor. But this does not of course prevent him from remaining also the interpreter of his deepest convictions. 

One of these profound beliefs was that a society suffers more from the rapid and significant upheavals it can not hope to benefit from. No doubt this similar idea came to her in part from her own history. But it also harmonized very well with its specifically sociological conceptions, which assumed that social facts were complex, deeply rooted in consciousness, and subject to long-lasting and tenacious historical influences. Any imbalance in the social order, therefore, might lead to disorders, of which men would have more reason to complain than to rejoice. This is what he called anomie. 

If you are trying to profit from Durkheim's reading-that is, if you hope to enrich your thoughts from his own, even if it contradicts it-I suggest that you do not content yourself with a " To assimilate what he says to the mere manifestation of an indecrettable conservatism. 

Let us take the example of a statement he made in 1911 concerning sex education (see Émile Durkheim, "Texts, 2. religion, morals, anomie", 1975, pp. 241-251). One can see in it only the manifestation of a well-thinking mind, indignant at the idea that sexual relations outside marriage may not be deemed immoral. Yet the arguments he puts forward should be taken into account. He explains that, sociologically, the sexual act is not a social act like any other, that it is and has always been considered in a particular way. And he puts forward a notion to which he is (without doubt very rightly) attached, that of the sacred (cf. "The elementary forms of religious life", PUF, 1968, pp. 49-66). Sexual contact would, a priori, be a kind of profanation, of which only the permanence of the couple would efface the attack. This is an idea which it is doubtless difficult to accept nowadays, especially at the dawn of sexual life, and which, however, may prove to be of great help in attempts to explain the social distress which, Sometimes engender unfaithful sexual behavior. 

In this case, the question of the right to marginality is not properly at issue. Above all, it is a matter of explaining the social world, not of governing it. And if your preferences go to this or that form of family or sexual life, it is up to you to know how to throw a gaze on the world around you that does not owe them everything.
