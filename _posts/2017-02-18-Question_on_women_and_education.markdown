Hello sir, 

I would have liked to know the reasons why women stop studying earlier than boys, whereas they do better than them at the end of high school. 

I thank you in advance for your reply.

In 1998, I published a book entitled "Male domination". In this book I have attempted to show how the mechanisms that guarantee the privileges enjoyed by men in relation to women are part of systems of thought that are apparently innocent of all inequality. The choices which ensure male domination are most often based on evidence which seems to be absent and, moreover, are unconnected with the history and struggles it recognizes. 

The unconscious character of these logics explains why a not insignificant part of male domination is based on the decisions taken by the dominated ones themselves. Thus, among many other things, I found it useful to draw attention to the fact that, from their earliest childhood, girls are constituted as symbolic objects whose being is a perceived being. Very early, their first insecurity is bodily: they feel looked at and held to appear as a welcoming, attractive, available object. This form of so-called "femininity" is in fact nothing but complacency towards male expectations. Thus, the relationship of dependence with men tends to become constitutive of their being. 

One consequence of this is that women do not obtain the same amount of education as men. And it will often be the instructions they have been led to incorporate from the earliest age that will push them to refuse the fate that men, on their side, will prefer. And all this without the slightest unevenness of treatment appearing in the open.
