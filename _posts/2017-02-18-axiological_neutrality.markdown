Dear Pierre Bourdieu,

At the beginning of your scientific career, you have often denounced intellectual prophetism and moralism, in the name of which certain sociologists allow themselves to derive from sociological knowledge the instructions of behavior that reflect what must be done. You were willing to quote Weber, who asserted that one could not forge a conception of the world from knowledge. From the beginning of the 1990s, you have increasingly manifested feelings of revolt against the social order, relying on the sociological knowledge you owe to your research. Is there not a reversal on your part? Has not this new attitude damaged the reputation of your work? Have you not violated the principle of axiological neutrality?

Thank you to enlighten me.

Respectfully.

**Michel Collaine**

The question you are raising is one of the most difficult to solve and, to convince you of it, I can not do better than to trace to you - somewhat schematically, of course - the itinerary that has been mine about him. I can distinguish four stages.

##First stage

When, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, I carried out research in Algeria in collaboration with INSEE statisticians, I was very concerned about respecting the principles of axiological neutrality ("Wertfreiheit"), Which Max Weber had defined. "An empirical science can not teach anyone what it should do, but only what it can and, if need be, what it wants to do." Choosing what is good to do is an approach that demands that the general objectives pursued have been defined beforehand; And these latter necessarily have moral foundations which owe nothing to the empire. At that time I was surrounded by Marxists whose anti-colonialist fervor was a pleasure to see, but who-as far as sociological research was concerned-gladly neglected the problem of truthfulness in favor of subjugating their analyzes to doctrinal patterns pre-established. And at the beginning of my collaboration with Jean-Claude Passeron, I often had to temper his revolutionary ardor. When we devote ourselves to sociology, we are forced to admit that Weber had been able to spot the errors committed by those - such as Marx - who inconsiderately mixed the rigor of heuristic approaches and faith in moral values. Durkheim also knew how to define the conditions of a scientific sociology, even if he had probably not isolated as judiciously as Weber the fundamental difficulty to which this ambition was confronted. To mention only one aspect of this difficulty, I would point out that Weber extended his principle of axiological neutrality from another, equally important principle, namely the need to "understand" the values ​​to which the Agents ("Wertbeziehung"). I should not have been able to point out a whole series of phenomena explaining the extent to which the Algerian dominated were unable to get rid of domination (see, in particular, "Uprooting" written with Abdelmalek Sayad) Were not committed to respecting these Weberian principles.

##Second step

In 1964, when we had to conclude the research that Jean-Claude Passeron and I had conducted on students and culture ("Les Héritiers"), we had very long discussions about the following question: Should we allow ourselves to indicate what pedagogically deserved to be done? We have come to believe that, insofar as the objective of democratization of education was unanimously proclaimed, it was not incongruous to recommend any particular orientation to favor it. After all, since the objective is a given, nothing prevents us from establishing relations between a given political choice and what research suggests as consequences. At that time, we were essentially concerned about the need, as soon as research began, to break with common sense - and that is why we had been reading Bachelard abundantly - rather than the final purpose of our Work (see "The profession of sociologist" written with Chamboredon and Passeron).

##Third step

In the early 1970s, my doubts about the scope that the published works could have on the evolution of the social world were at the origin of some divergences with Jean-Claude Passeron. He had become more and more concerned about the independence of research, whereas I personally wished to take into account that the choices of research themes were not themselves politically innocent. The creation at the beginning of 1975 of the "Acts of research in the social sciences" translated my own evolution quite well. In fact, the problem of the relationship between values ​​and political choices, on the one hand, and research methods and choices, on the other hand, is most complex. The problem was relatively well posed by Weber, but the solution was not less indistinguishable, especially as soon as - and I was soon convinced - sociological research itself deserved to be an object of sociological research . It is probably very probable that what differentiated Jean-Claude Passeron from me was essentially due to our respective curricula. This is what I tried to unravel the skein when I made the choice, during my last lesson at the Collège de France, to provide a set of elements allowing to build a parallel between my story and my choices .

##Fourth step

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I became increasingly aware of the pitfall of sociological research that was left to professional sociologists. This awareness is evidently related to the evolution of the social world, a social world in which neo-liberal conceptions had taken the form of elementary common sense. It seemed to me then that it was the responsibility of intellectuals who had access to truths that could make apparent what this ideology concealed to testify to it. With of course the enormous difficulties that this implied. I was not surprised by the malicious interpretations of my public speeches on the occasion of strikes and social movements; They showed how the system defended itself. But I am aware that the attempts to elucidate the mechanisms by which domination overcame everything that attempted to denounce it exacerbated the struggles and tarnished my credibility. I recall the discussion on January 20, 1996 with Jean-Marie Cavada (in the program "Arrêt sur images"), during which the latter fully mastered an exercise that I wanted to denounce The hidden mechanisms, has succeeded-and there is no point in keeping it silent-using some of these mechanisms to make me wear the habit of bad faith. It would obviously be very useful to analyze how he did it, on what "evidences" he relied, with which mixture of aplomb and false good conscience he avoided any questioning. But the media are places where the weapons that guarantee success are monopolized by those who satisfy the expectations of those who control them. It would obviously be wrong to believe that an inclination to mediocrity only reflects the search for an audimat to fill advertisers; It corresponds above all to a logic of thought which systematically rejects all that promotes the understanding of things, inasmuch as such intelligence can only result in the discovery of the instruments of domination. The gap between the rich and the poor has probably never been as sharp as it is today; It is mainly due to the fact that the means used by the dominants to widen this gap are camouflaged behind an appearance of equality and humanism.
