Hello Mr. Bourdieu, 

Your analysis of a phenomenon that affects young adolescents and adults: what do you think of this return to a culture called "Gothic" with music sometimes noisy, a passion for black and cruel images? 

Thank you for your eyes 



See you

**Hubert**

I have not studied the phenomenon you are talking about, so I would not want to talk about it. I would be tempted to ask your own opinion on this. For if you ask yourself this question, it is because you think that it is perhaps possible to understand the origin, the function and the logic of this social movement.
