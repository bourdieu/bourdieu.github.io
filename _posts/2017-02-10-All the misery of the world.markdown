Pierre, 

Now that I know you there to answer my questions, I will resume reading the book cited in the subject. What was your PURPOSE in writing this book? 

Thank you in advance and to the pleasure of reading to you.

Perhaps you have now finished reading "The Poverty of the World". And perhaps this reading raises questions. 

Why did I undertake these investigations with more than twenty other investigators and why did we decide to publish them? 

Since the 1930s there has always been a kind of opposition between a sociology devoted to the most general questions of social functioning (macro-sociology, in a way) and a sociology of everyday behavior (micro- sociology). And it was understood that the object of these two approaches was so specific to them that one had nothing to say about the object of the other. As if the sociological discourse on the general evolution of the social world evoked only phenomena totally unrelated to the behavior of social agents (when the latter is seized in its individuality). The Marxist vulgate was not for nothing in this way of seeing, it placed the determinants of the social world on the side of the infrastructure and referred the acts without consequences on the side of the superstructure. But there are also many allegedly methodological quarrels behind which for a long time those for whom the stake of sociology resided in the definition of its object and denied all legitimacy to a sociological research that claimed to go beyond the problematic (dear to some assistants Social) of the adaptation of the agent to his social environment. 

In recent decades, the political world has discovered a vocation to justify its decisions by science. And since the fall of communism has discredited any form of planning, it is of course towards a sociology of the "case" or even "pathology" that it has turned. All sociological considerations on the general functioning of the social world have become suspicious of ideology, when it presented above all as a danger only the elucidation of what is at the very foundation of the power held by politicians. 

There is, however, no reason why the link between the most general social logics and the seemingly most innocuous behaviors and ways of thinking can not be established. It is even imperative to search for such a link, both to avoid sinking into "theorism" and to overcome monographic complacency. In order to understand ordinary existence, it is therefore necessary to draw parallels between the conditions of production of social misery and the conditions of production of the concomitant forms of political domination. 

But the method adopted in the inquiry which presents "The misery of the world" also has its importance. It aims to neutralize the distortions that the investigation relationship usually introduces in communication. In order to take into account the fact that the respondent is not in any way predisposed to look at his or her own experience as an object of knowledge, we have been obliged to give access to the order of discourse to experiences that were experienced as foreign To the latter. Therefore, all questions which in themselves refer to theoretical knowledge as the main concern have been excluded and have been replaced by more comprehensive approaches to approach the logic of practice. 

The task thus defined is particularly complex. It is far from complete. "The misery of the world" traces a path in which it is important that, unceasingly, others engage.
