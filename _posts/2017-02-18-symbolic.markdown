Hello,

I am part of a group of visual artists, we are currently questioning the "symbolic function" of art, without succeeding in agreeing on the meaning and relevance of the term. What would be your definition of the symbolic? (Unfortunately, the question is not addressed in your reply on the Dialogus website entitled "Symbolic systems").

thank you,
